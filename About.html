        <h1>Problem & Solution</h1>
        <p>Problem - People aren’t taking their cars to the car washes due to the convenience and cost, visiting a car wash takes time out of a person's schedule and some people may prefer to save money by washing their cars themselves or not washing them at all. So, our goal is to solve this problem.​ ​</p>
        <p>Solution - Regular car washing businesses helps maintain the vehicle's aesthetics by keeping it clean and shiny, but our car wash business has benefits. To make it more convenient we bring our supplies to the persons house and wash their cars for cheap prices.​</p>
